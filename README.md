# Hello-World
My First Repository! 
Hello Everyoyne, I am a Highschool Freshman who's main passion is building apps and games. I am in the process of learning my first language, Python, and want to eventually learn Lua and Javascript. If you guys have any suggestions for more languages to learn, please tell me.
