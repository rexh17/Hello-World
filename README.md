# Hello-World
My First Repository! 
Hello Everyoyne, I am a 14 y/o Highschool Freshman who's main passion is building apps and games. I am in the process of learning my first language, Python, and want to eventually learn Lua and Javascript. If you guys have any suggestions for more languages to learn, or any tips on how to learn these languages, please tell me.
